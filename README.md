# 🥷 RonynDesk

**RonynDesk** is a modular, Python-based desktop framework designed to be your personal digital dojo. From a single clean UI, you can access and manage multiple utility apps — all built to enhance your daily workflow.

Inspired by the self-sufficient power of a ronin, RonynDesk is both **personal and extensible**, allowing users to plug in their own tools or use built-in ones.

Work in progress!!!
